# MY-PROJECTS
During the start of my full stack JavaScript development course, I engaged in several side projects to apply my learning and enhance my skills. I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and experiments, developed a task management app to streamline my study schedule, and built a simple e-commerce site to practice integrating front-end and back-end technologies.
